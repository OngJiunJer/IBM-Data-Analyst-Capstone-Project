## Step 1: Data Collection (Jupyter) 
  - Using API
  - Using Webscraping

## Step 2: Explore Data (Jupyter)

## Step 3: Data Wrangling (Jupyter)<br>
Data Wrangling or Munging is a process in which we clean up the data set and make it ready for data analysis. In this assignment you will perform the following tasks:
  - Identify duplicate rows in the data frame.
  - Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe.
  - Find the number of missing values for all columns.
  - Find the value counts for the column "Employment".
  - Normalize the data using two existing columns.  

## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (Jupyter)<br>
After cleaning the dataset, your next step is the analysis. In this stage you will become more familiar with the data set and it will start to take shape. In this assignment you will:
  - Plot a distribution curve, and histogram.
  - Find the median, and outliers of particular columns.
  - Compute the Inter Quartile Range.
  - Find out the upper and lower bounds, and find correlations between numerical columns.
  - Create a new dataframe.

## Step 5: Data Visualization
  - Create a histogram to show the distribution of data.
  - Create different plots such as a scatter, bubble or boxplot.
  - Create a pie chart, bar chart, and stacked chart to show medians and counts.

## Step 6: Creating Dashboard Via PowerBI
In this assignment will create a dashboard. In this dashboard you will create the following:
  - A Current Technology Usage tab containing:
      1) Top 10 Languages
      2) Top 10 Databases
      3) Top 10 Platforms
      4) Top 10 WebFrames
  - A Future Technology Trends tab containing:
      1) Top 10 Languages desired for the next year
      2) Top 10 Databases desired for the next year
      3) Desired platform for the next year
      4) Top 10 WebFrames desired for the next year
  - A Demographics tab containing:
      1) Respondent classified by gender
      2) Respondent count for countries
      3) Respondent count by age
      4) Respondent count by gender and classified by education level
