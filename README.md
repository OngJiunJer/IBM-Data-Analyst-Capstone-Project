Step 1: Data Collection (Jupyter)
  - Using API
  - Using Webscraping

Step 2: Explore Data (Jupyter)

Step 3: Data Wrangling (Jupyter)<br>
Data Wrangling or Munging is a process in which we clean up the data set and make it ready for data analysis. In this assignment you will perform the following tasks:
  - Identify duplicate rows in the data frame.
  - Remove duplicate rows from the dataframe.
  - Find the number of missing values for all columns.
  - Find the value counts for the column "Employment".
  - Normalize the data using two existing columns.  

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (Jupyter)<br>
After cleaning the dataset, your next step is the analysis. In this stage you will become more familiar with the data set and it will start to take shape. In this assignment you will:
  - Plot a distribution curve, and histogram.
  - Find the median, and outliers of particular columns.
  - Compute the Inter Quartile Range.
  - Find out the upper and lower bounds, and find correlations between numerical columns.
  - Create a new dataframe.
